**Project Requirements:**

* Analyze Airbnb data for the Manhattan vacation rental market.
* Identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property types for investment.
* Estimate the revenue potential of top-performing listings.

**Data Source:**

* NYC Airbnb Data 

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**
    * **Neighborhood Data:**
        * Clean the "neighborhood" column by removing inconsistent capitalization and trailing spaces.
        * Create a new column "neighborhood_clean" to store the cleaned data.
    * **Bedroom Data:**
        * Clean the "bedrooms" column by handling empty cells (representing studio apartments).
        * Create a new column "bedrooms_clean" to store the cleaned data.

2. **Neighborhood Analysis:**
    * **Identify Top 10 Neighborhoods:**
        * Use "number_of_reviews_ltm" as a proxy for rental attractiveness.
        * Create a pivot table to analyze review counts by neighborhood.
        * Identify the top 10 neighborhoods with the highest review counts.
    * **Visualize Results:**
        * Create a bar chart to display the number of reviews for the top 10 neighborhoods.

3. **Property Size Analysis:**
    * **Determine Most Popular Property Sizes:**
        * Create a pivot table to analyze the frequency of different property sizes (number of bedrooms).
    * **Analyze Neighborhood Preferences:**
        * Update the pivot table to analyze property size preferences within each of the top 10 neighborhoods.

4. **Revenue Analysis:**
    * **Identify Top-Performing Listings:**
        * Create a new column "top_listing" in the listings data.
        * Assign a value of 1 to listings that match the criteria (top 10 neighborhoods and their corresponding most popular property sizes).
    * **Calculate Revenue:**
        * In the calendar data, create a new column "revenue_earned" to calculate revenue earned each night.
        * In the listings data, create a "revenue_earned" column using SUMIF() to calculate total revenue from the calendar data.
    * **Rank Top Listings:**
        * Create a pivot table to rank top listings by revenue using "top_listing" as a filter.
        * Estimate annual revenue by multiplying 30-day revenue by 12.

**Next Steps:**

* Conduct further analysis on seasonality, competitive landscape, and guest demographics.
* Develop predictive models to forecast future demand and revenue.
* Implement dynamic pricing strategies to optimize revenue generation.
