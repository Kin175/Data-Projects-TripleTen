**Data**

* **Source:** "raw_user_activity" sheet in the provided Google Spreadsheet.
* **Columns:**

**Conclusions**

[Summarize key insights and potential implications of the analysis. 
For example: 
* "The analysis revealed a significant drop-off rate between product page views and cart additions, suggesting a need for improvements in product descriptions or user experience."
* "Cohort analysis identified a high initial retention rate, but a decline in retention over subsequent months, indicating a potential need for customer engagement strategies to improve long-term customer loyalty."]

**Change Log/Assumptions**

* [Document any changes made to the analysis or the data.] 
* [List any assumptions made during the analysis.]
