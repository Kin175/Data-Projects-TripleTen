**Project Requirements:**

**1. Conversion Funnel Analysis:**

* **Objective:** Determine the effectiveness of the website in converting product page views into purchases.
* **Steps:**
    * Create a new sheet: `conversion_funnel`
    * Build a pivot table to count unique users at each stage of the funnel:
        * Stage 1: Product Page Views
        * Stage 2: Cart Adds
        * Stage 3: Purchases
    * Calculate:
        * Total conversion rates for each stage
        * Conversion rates between each stage 

**2. Cohort Analysis:**

* **Objective:** Analyze user behavior based on their initial purchase month.
* **Steps:**
    * **Data Preparation:**
        * Create a new sheet: `purchase_activity` 
        * Filter `raw_user_activity` to include only "purchase" events.
        * Create a new sheet: `first_purchase`
        * Use a pivot table to determine the `first_purchase_date` for each user.
        * Add a `first_purchase_date` column to `purchase_activity` using `VLOOKUP`.
        * Create new columns in `purchase_activity`:
            * `event_month` (YYYY-MM)
            * `first_purchase_month` (YYYY-MM)
            * `cohort_age` (number of months since first purchase)
    * **Cohort Creation:**
        * Create a new sheet: `cohort_analysis`
        * Build a pivot table to group users by `first_purchase_month` and count unique users for each `cohort_age`.

**3. Retention Rate Calculation:**

* **Objective:** Determine user retention rates for each cohort over time.
* **Steps:**
    * Create a new sheet: `retention_rates`
    * Create a table with cohorts as rows and cohort ages as columns.
    * Calculate retention rates for each cohort at each age using data from `cohort_analysis`.

**4. Spreadsheet Organization & Documentation:**

* **Executive Summary:** 
    * Summarize key findings from `conversion_funnel` and `retention_rates` sheets.
    * Document data assumptions and limitations.
* **Table of Contents:** 
    * Create a table listing all sheets with brief descriptions.
* **Formatting:**
    * Apply formatting for readability (e.g., number formats, borders, bold headers, frozen panes).
* **Sheet Ordering:**
    * Organize sheets: `Table of Contents`, `Executive Summary`, analysis sheets (`conversion_funnel`, `retention_rates`), calculation sheets, `raw_user_activity`.

**Project Submission:**

* Share the Google Spreadsheet with view-only permissions to allow reviewers to access the analysis.
